    <p>As an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Faculty of Computer Science, I used modern trends in Android programming and the library Android Plot to update and add user functionality to an Android app that analyses network traffic.</p>
  
    <p>The app records leakage incidents: where an app sends sensitive user information across the network. I displayed this data graphically along with app foreground/background events that Android automatically records. Thus, I was able to categorise leaks as having occurred in the app foreground or not. I displayed pie charts summarising leaks by category and foreground status, and gave the user a UI to define custom queries on the in-app SQLite database.</p>

  <p>As an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Faculty of Computer Science, I used modern trends in Android programming to completely redesign the UI of an Android app that runs investment portfolio simulations. My favourite thing about this URA was the freedom to be as creative as possible. For four months, I was the sole programmer, UI designer, and decision maker when implementing new features.</p>
