		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>I just finished second year at the University of Waterloo.  
		I am completing a degree in Mathematics with majors in Applied 
		Mathematics, Computer Science, and Computational Mathematics.  
		So far in university, I have completed 26 courses over 4 terms, 
		12 of which were at the advanced level in mathematics and computer
		science.  I have consistently taken advantage of any opportunity to 			learn and grow.</p>  
		<p>In 2013 and 2014, my partner and I won back-to-back Canadian 
		National Beach Volleyball Championships in the 18U and 22U divisions 
		respectively.  In 2015, my partner and I won the 24U Ontario Beach 
		Volleyball Championships.  This was the result of full-time training 
		with Team Ontario over two summers.  This training focused on both 
		physical and mental performance while under the instruction of top 
		Canadian coaches.</p>
		<p>I came into university with no programming experience, however 
		I have grown to love computer science because of its relevance and 
		application everywhere.</p>
