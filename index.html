	I just finished second year at the University of Waterloo.  I am 
	completing a degree in Mathematics with majors in Applied Mathematics, 
	Computer Science, and Computational Mathematics.  So far in university, 
	I have completed 26 courses over 4 terms, 12 of which were at the 
	advanced level in mathematics and computer science.  I have consistently 
	taken advantage of any opportunity to learn and grow.

<p>
	In 2013 and 2014, my partner and I won back-to-back Canadian National 
	Beach Volleyball Championships in the 18U and 22U divisions respectively. 
	 In 2015, my partner and I won the 24U Ontario Beach Volleyball Championships. 
	 This was the result of full-time training with Team Ontario over two summers. 
	 This training focused on both physical and mental performance while under the 
	instruction of top Canadian coaches.

<p>
	I came into university with no programming experience, however I have grown to 
	love computer science because of its relevance and application everywhere.
