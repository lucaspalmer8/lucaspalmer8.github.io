One of my motivations for enrolling in a part-time graduate program at USF was the opportunity
to participate in club sports. Even though I only played a few years of little league baseball
back in the day, I was excited to mix it up from my usual volleyball scene and try something
new.

This experience was definitely outside of my comfort zone, and I couldn't help but think of the
movie <i>22 Jump Street</i> due to my age difference. The USF club baseball team was a really
welcoming environment with great people. Getting to learn the basics again was a rewarding
experience.
