        <h2>Software Developer, Spring 2016</h2>
        <h3>Toast Inc.</h3>
        <h3>Boston, MA</h3>
        <p>
        	Toast is an all-in-one restaurant POS system and restaurant management system. Built specifically 
			for restaurants on an affordable cloud-based platform, Toast offers the power, flexibility, and ease 
			of use a food-service business needs.
		</p>

		<p>
			My first intern project was to fully develop a new Android display that summarizes orders to improve restaurant
			efficiency. This new feature got 1284 views with an average view time of 41 seconds in its first two weeks at 20 restaurants.
			In addition, I worked on a team of three to build the consumer-facing kiosk feature in the Android app, allowing customers to 
			efficiently place and pay for orders themselves. When a customer was threatening to leave because cash drawers were taking up 
			to 6 seconds to open, I investigated and implemented a fix that reduced the time by 40x.

        <h2>Software Developer, Fall 2015</h2>
        <h3>BigRoad Inc.</h3>
        <h3>Waterloo, ON</h3>
        <p>
        	BigRoad sets out to collaborate with individuals and businesses in the transportation industry to build the best fleet 
			management platform using today’s technologies.  BigRoad is the #1 trucker app for Android, iPhone, and iPad, and is the 
			overwhelming choice of drivers and fleets using smart phones in their daily operations.
		</p>

        <p>
        	The first thing I did at BigRoad was greatly expand the Selenium and Appium automated testing suites in the early stages of
			the company’s automated testing infrastructure. Later on in my internship, I implemented new behavior in aspects of the Android 
			app to display additional information and prevent the app from recording redundant data.

        <h3>Side Effects Software</h3>
        <h3>Toronto, ON</h3>
        <p>
        	Side Effects Inc. is a computer graphics business located in downtown Toronto. Its flagship product is Houdini, an 
			award-winning software used for high-end visual effects as well as 3D animation in film and videogames.  
		</p>

        <p>
        	My first project was to create a node to control world-level geometry objects using Python scripts.
			Later on, I took an old passive network tree and turned it into a useful scene management tool by
			allowing artists to select similar nodes in the geometry node hierarchy.
