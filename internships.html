			I was on the contextual carryover team within the Alexa machine learning platform.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My first project was to write a Python script that updates model training sets to better match live
			data in the NLU pipeline. Next, I built a Django-powered web tool that generates test cases for model testing and training.

			I was on the personal actions team within the Google Assistant team.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My first intern project was to create a query rewrite feature in Google Assistant Server with validation 
			logic in Android and iOS frontends. Next, I used internal Google technologies to create a Google Assistant
			dialog for modifying settings with voice commands.  Finally, I built the initial version of the iOS frontend
			for an upcoming Google Assistant feature.

        <h2>Software Developer, Spring 2016, Toast Inc.</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/" target="_blank"><img class="toast-logo" src="images/toastlogo.png"></a></h3>
        <h3>Boston, MA</h3>

        <p>
        	Toast is an all-in-one restaurant POS system and restaurant management system. Built specifically 
			for restaurants on an affordable cloud-based platform, Toast offers the power, flexibility, and ease 
			of use a food-service business needs.
		</p>

		<p>
			My first intern project was to fully develop a new Android display that summarizes orders to improve restaurant
			efficiency. This new feature got 1284 views with an average view time of 41 seconds in its first two weeks at 20 restaurants.
			In addition, I worked on a team of three to build the consumer-facing kiosk feature in the Android app, allowing customers to 
			efficiently place and pay for orders themselves. When a customer was threatening to leave because cash drawers were taking up 
			to 6 seconds to open, I investigated and implemented a fix that reduced the time by 40x.

        <h3>Waterloo, ON</h3>

        	BigRoad sets out to collaborate with individuals and businesses in the transportation industry to build the best fleet 
			management platform using today’s technologies.  BigRoad is the #1 trucker app for Android, iPhone, and iPad, and is the 
			overwhelming choice of drivers and fleets using smart phones in their daily operations.
		</p>

        <p>
        	The first thing I did at BigRoad was greatly expand the Selenium and Appium automated testing suites in the early stages of
			the company’s automated testing infrastructure. Later on in my internship, I implemented new behavior in aspects of the Android 
			app to display additional information and prevent the app from recording redundant data.

        	My first project was to create a node to control world-level geometry objects using Python scripts.
			Later on, I took an old passive network tree and turned it into a useful scene management tool by
			allowing artists to select similar nodes in the geometry node hierarchy.
