  <h2>University of Waterloo</h2>
  <h3>September 2013 - April 2018</h3>

  <p>
    I received my Bachelor of Mathematics from the University of
    Waterloo in 2018 with majors in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics,
    and Computational Mathematics. I completed these degree requirements
    by taking additional courses beyond a full-time course load every
    semester while maintaining a cumulative 92% average. I interned at five
    different technology companies through the University of Waterlooâ€™s
    co-op program
